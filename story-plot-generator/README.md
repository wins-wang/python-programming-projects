# Story Plot Generator System

## üìò Overview
This project implements a **Story Plot Generator System** featuring random and interactive plot creation tools, developed with **object-oriented design principles** and an emphasis on separating model and view responsibilities (similar to the MVC pattern).

The system allows:
- Simple random plot generation.
- Fully randomized plot construction using multiple thematic components.
- Interactive user-driven plot assembly by selecting among random options.

This project demonstrates class inheritance, modular design, and user interaction strategies in Python.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Key Techniques**:
  - Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Inheritance, Extension)
  - MVC-inspired Model and View separation
  - File reading and random sampling
  - Modular and reusable code structure

---

## üß† Design Approach
The project includes three main generator classes:

- **SimplePlotGenerator**:  
  Always generates the fixed plot "Something happens."

- **RandomPlotGenerator**:  
  Randomly assembles a plot by combining elements from multiple input files:
  - Names, adjectives, professions, verbs, villain descriptions.

- **InteractivePlotGenerator**:  
  Guides the user through making choices step-by-step to assemble a custom plot.

Each generator **registers a viewer** (like `PlotViewer`) to handle input/output, ensuring the generators remain agnostic to the I/O format (console, GUI, etc.).

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run
1. Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed.
2. Place all provided `.txt` files and the script in the same working directory:
    - `plot_generator_system.py`
    - `plot_names.txt`
    - `plot_adjectives.txt`
    - `plot_profesions.txt`
    - `plot_verbs.txt`
    - `plot_adjectives_evil.txt`
    - `plot_villian_job.txt`
    - `plot_villains.txt`
3. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python plot_generator_system.py
    ```
4. Follow the prompts to generate a random or interactive story plot!

*Note*:  
- `DieRollerExample.txt` is provided as a reference for the initial MVC architecture idea.
