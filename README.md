# Python Programming Projects Collection

## üìò Overview
This repository showcases a curated collection of Python programming projects that I developed to systematically strengthen my core software development skills.  

Each project emphasizes modular program design, top-down design principles, algorithmic thinking, object-oriented development, and simulation techniques, demonstrating a structured and practical approach to solving real-world problems.

Through these projects, I explored essential programming domains such as file handling, algorithm optimization (O(n log n)), custom web scraping with HTML parsing, pseudo-random number generation, and Monte Carlo simulations.  

I focused on writing clear, maintainable, and modular code, applying structured problem-solving strategies to progress from foundational concepts to applied programming practices with real-world relevance.

| [Cups and Dice Game](./cups-and-dice-game/) | Developed a full object-oriented dice game simulation with balance tracking and multiple dice types. | OOP, Class Inheritance, Game Logic |
| [Goldbach Deuce](./goldbach-deuce/) | Built an optimized Two-Sum algorithm to efficiently find number pairs that add up to a target value. | Algorithm Optimization, Binary Search |
| [Story Plot Generator System](./story-plot-generator/) | Created a modular system for random and interactive story plot generation following an MVC-inspired structure. | OOP, MVC Principles, File Handling |
| [Surf CDM Web Scraper](./surf-cdm-web-scraper/) | Developed a web scraper that extracts visible text from the CDM website and analyzes word frequencies. | HTML Parsing, Text Analysis |
| [War and Peace PRNG and Overlapping Ellipses Simulation](./warpeace-prng-overlapping-ellipses/) | Designed a custom PRNG from *War and Peace* text and applied it in a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate geometric overlap. | PRNG, Monte Carlo Simulation, 2D Geometry |
